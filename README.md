# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API.  The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently. The bug occurs when the data is received, but the FlatList fails to update the UI. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an Android or iOS emulator/device.
3. Observe the FlatList; it may be empty or display the data correctly (intermittently).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `data` prop of the `FlatList` is correctly updated and that any potential issues with key extraction are addressed.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected implementation.
